# Blackboard-YAML

Generate quizzes for Blackboard Learnâ„¢ from a YAML+Markdown
specification. We use the CSV-import feature of Blackboard, but format
the CSV file so the questions and answers can have code blocks or
other sorts of markup.

See the `example.yaml` file for a sample input. To generate the
output, simply run:

    ./bbtest example.yaml

This produces two files:

 - `example.html`
 - `example.txt`

You can view the HTML file to debug your markup and generally check
your work. The sample output file is included in the repository for
your convenience. The text file contains CSV that you upload into the
Blackboard test center.

Requires python-yaml and python-markdown. Currently supports
multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions only. Contributions
welcome.

Enjoy!
